The tools analysts use in their daily tasks are simple and straight forward. Although, they might seem hyperbolically uncountable due to continuous emergence of new applications 
that could equally be of good use; you will always find an element of these common ones that I’m about to mention in most of them. My first two might be a surprise.

1)	**Ability to Read and Understand, and the Ability to Write**: If you happen to stumble on my web page and you are wondering; why this skill? It’s because I believe you can learn anything as long as you can read and write. Analyzing data and writing codes perhaps are not exceptions.

2)	**Patient**: Intuition might not be of a great help. Take time to critically examine the data and make sure that the result is backed by facts from your data. You need to calm down and possibly take a bit of time when things aren’t going as expected. If you eventually get to that stage where you start coding, you have to be patient when those errors started screaming at you - I don’t mean literally; just remember that you’ve done nothing wrong – the programming language you’re using just can’t understand you. Don’t forget that a comma “,” instead of a full stop “.“ and a “Print” instead of a “print” will never fetch you the result that you want.

3)	**Spreadsheets**: They are used for: 
- Storing data for further analysis either in the spreadsheet’s environment or in another environment e.g. Python and Tableau.
- Cleaning data to remove unwanted elements and ensure accurate result during analysis.
- Analyzing data by performing necessary calculations and deriving insights from the data.
- Visualize the data by representing analytical results on graphs or charts.

The most popular spreadsheets are the Microsoft Excel and the Google spreadsheets and both can be used for free on line with Google account (for Google sheet) and Microsoft account (for Excel).

4) **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: It’s the language of the relational databases that stored data in tabular form. In databases, data can only be accessed using SQL. The most common and accessible relational database management systems that are available to the public are PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Server SQL. Should you be working in an organization where they generate huge amount of data, it’s very likely that these data will be stored in database and SQL knowledge will be handy for querying the database.

5) **Tableau**: It’s an interactive visualization API that does not require coding. The resultant visual(s) can equally be published on Tableau. [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is free. Access [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) and learn more.

For a Data Analyst, the above-mentioned skills should get you started, these last two skills are additional knowledge that can help you move further in your career.  

6) **R**: It is a programming language that is designed specifically for statistical and data analysis. You can learn more about [R](https://www.r-project.org/) on their website.
7) **Python**: Sufficient to say python is the most popular programming language due to its popularity among data scientists and analyst. You can read more about [Python](https://www.python.org/) to learn more.
